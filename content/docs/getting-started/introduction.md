This is a highly technical course and something potentially helpful for someone in a software engineer adjacent track (you work near them or deal with software). It's a summation of my personal career to date and an effort to both refresh and sharpen my own skills as well as hone the skills of others. I love teaching and I love tech.

I'm going to release content periodically and will send updates to my LinkedIn feed as well as an e-mail list for those who wish to subscribe. Follow me there if you want to stay tuned.

My content is pretty informal but I keep it PC. No politics or lewd stuff, the occasional swear word for emphasis, mostly tongue-in-cheek humor. 


## What is a 10x Engineer?

A 10x engineer (10xer) is: 

> A particularly talented and productive engineer, thought to be capable of doing the work of ten typical engineers. 

It's a bit of a meme, but sharpening skills is the point. Maybe you're just a 5xer...or a 2xer...or a 1xer?

## What do I need to follow along?

You should be writing code throughout this and are encouraged to experiment with it.

I work on a Ubuntu desktop machine and recommend that. A Macbook also works (Unix based). We'll use a lot of command line tools and Windows isn't well equipped out of the box. 

If you're on Windows then you're on your own. This is a Linux world anyways.
