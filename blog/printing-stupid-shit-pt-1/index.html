    <p>I often need something mundane and either creative or vigorous to do as an outlet; drawing, chopping wood, doing yardwork, hitting a punching bag, etc. Lately this has been 3d printing objects that serve some purpose around the house. My <em>pièce de résistance</em> is a part that fixes a drawer in the kitchen due to a bent rail.</p>
<p>I was doing some cleaning in my office and decided it would be nice to have some hooks for these hand grippers I have on my desk.</p>
<p>I could have gone to the hardware store, but I felt like being lazy, so I did what any lazy person would do....I modeled some hooks in CAD software and 3d printed some instead. It may sound crazy but the math kinda maths.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">This sick retro 8-bit anime themed song came on the rotation during the making of this video and I decided it's the theme song for this vid.</p>

<h2 id="the-math">The Math</h2>
<ul>
<li>The closest hardware store is 2 miles away.</li>
<li>The average price of wall hooks I see on their store is $3 (for a pack of 6).</li>
<li>My truck gets about ~15 miles to the gallon.</li>
<li>Gas is ~$5 where I live.</li>
<li>1 spool of filament is 1kg and cost me $30.</li>
<li>1 gram is therefore about $0.03.</li>
<li>1 hook will print about 6 grams of filament.</li>
</ul>
<p>$$ costdriving = {((miles/milespergallon) * gasprice) + hookcost} $$</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>$$ costprinting = {(spoolcost/spoolamount) * gramsused * hooksprinted} $$</p>
<p style="font-size: 2em;">
If I were to drive ~4 miles to purchase hooks it would cost me ~$4.33.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 2em;">
If I were to 3d print hooks it would cost me ~$0.72, plus I don't have to go anywhere or get dressed.
</p>
<p>The choice is clear.</p>
<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
<p>I need basically a simple j-hook and plan to use a drywall screw to fix it to the wall. I need 4 of them.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a> (FOSS) for modeling. I keep it pretty simple and get most of this info from youtube. A few straight lines with dimensions, padding, some circles with pockets, and that's good for now. Export this as an STL and load it into the slicer.</p>

<h2 id="slicing">Slicing</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/">PrusaSlicer</a> to import the CAD file and prep it for printing. I already have this tuned to my printer's Z-offset, some custom macros, and a brim. I export the g-code and prepare the printer.</p>

<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>
<p>I have an Ender 5 Pro. It's a good machine for tinkering. It takes a bit to get it dialed in but you can customize it a lot. Once it's dialed you get great prints.</p>
<img src="/images/20231228-printer.gif" width="40%" />
<p>The printer has been flashed with <a href="https://www.klipper3d.org/">Klipper</a> to give me some lower level capabilities and higher performance. I'm also using <a href="https://octoprint.org/">OctoPrint</a> running on a Raspberry Pi which controls the printer via USB serial and has a nice web interface for managing things remotely. The printer is 5 feet away from my desk but it is nice to check on prints when doing other stuff. I mainly use this for the timelapse feature which is a lot of fun.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>It took me about 4 hours to print all the hooks. This is the end result. It's not my Mona Lisa but I think it's pretty sick.</p>
